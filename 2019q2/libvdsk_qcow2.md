Add support for using QCOW in bhyve using the libvdsk library. Libvdsk was used
to substitute the regular disk operations from bhyve with a call to libvdsk
which will in turn call the disk-specific handler for the operation.

To use this feature one has to install the libvdsk-enabled bhyve version along
with libvdsk from the libvdsk repo linked above.

New features added:

   * Extend libvdsk to make it easier to implement new formats;
   * Improve read/write performance and stability;
   * Add support for Copy-On-Write;

Future tasks:

   * Integrate libvdsk in bhyve.

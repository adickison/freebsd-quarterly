## IRC Admin ##

Contact: IRC Admin, <irc@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD IRC Admin team manages the FreeBSD Project's presence
and activity on the freenode IRC network, looking after:

 * Registration and management of channels within the official namespace (`#freebsd*`)
 * Channel moderation
 * Liaising with freenode staff
 * Allocating `freebsd/*` hostmask cloaks for users
 * General user support relating to channel management

While the FreeBSD Project does not _currently_ endorse IRC as an
official support channel [1][2], as it has not been able to guarantee
a consistent or positive user experience, IRC Admin has been working
toward creating a high quality experience, by standardising channel
administration and moderation expectations, and ensuring the projects
ability to manage all channels within its namespace.

In the last quarter, IRC Admin:

 * Cleaned up (deregistered) registrations for channels that were defunct,
   stale, out of date, or had founders that were inactive (not seen for > 1
   year). Channels that were found to be otherwise active have been retained.
   FreeBSD now has ~40 channels registered from a previous total of over 150.
 * Documented baseline configuration settings in the Wiki for channels,
   including ChanServ settings, channel modes, registration policy, etc.
 * Established multiple documented methods for reporting user abuse
   or other channel issues to IRC Admin for resolution
 
Upcoming changes:

 * Work with existing `#freebsd*` channels to standardise channel management,
   settings and access.
 * Migrate, forward and/or consolidate existing or duplicate `#freebsd*`
   channels to channels with a standard naming convention.
 * Work with unofficial `##freebsd*` channels to migrate them to the official
   `#freebsd*` channels if suitable
 * Update existing IRC-related website and documentation sources the describe
   the official state of project managed IRC presence on freenode.

Lastly, and to repeat a previous call, while the vast majority of
the broader user community interacts on the freenode IRC network,
the FreeBSD developer presence still needs to be significantly
improved on freenode.

There are many opportunities to be had by increasing the amount and
quality of interaction between FreeBSD users and developers, both
in terms of developers keeping their finger on the pulse of the
community and in encouraging and cultivating greater contributions
to the Project over the long term.

It is critical to have a strong developer presence amongst users,
and IRC Admin would like again to call on all developers to join
the FreeBSD freenode channels to increase that presence.

Users are invited to `/join #freebsd-irc` on the freenode IRC network
if they have questions, ideas, constructive criticism, and feedback
on how the FreeBSD Project can improve the service and experience
it provides to the community on IRC.

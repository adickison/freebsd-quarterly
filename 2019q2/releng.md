The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

During the second quarter of 2019, the FreeBSD Release Engineering team
started the 11.3-RELEASE cycle, with the code slush starting May 3rd.
Throughout the cycle, there were three BETA builds and three RC builds,
all of which in line with the originally-published schedule.  The final RC
build started June 28th, with the final release build targeted for July 5th.

FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE will be the fourth release from the *stable/11*
branch, building on the stability and reliability of 11.2-RELEASE.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team also published the schedule for the
12.1-RELEASE, targeted to start September 6th.  One important thing to note
regarding the published schedule is it excludes a hard freeze on the
*stable/12* branch, as a test run for eliminating code freezes entirely during
a release cycle.  Commits to what will be the *releng/12.1* branch will still
require explicit approval from the Release Engineering Team, however.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/12*, and *stable/11* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation and Rubicon
Communications, LLC (Netgate).

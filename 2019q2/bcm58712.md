The Semihalf team continued working on FreeBSD support for the
[Broadcom BCM5871X SoC series](https://www.broadcom.com/products/embedded-and-networking-processors/communications/bcm58712/)

BCM5871X are quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A57 communication
processors targeted for networking applications such as 10G routers,
gateways, control plane processing and NAS.

* Completed since the last update:
   * iProc PCIe root complex (internal and external buses)
       * Fixes and improvements
       * Add BCM58712 quirk to GICv2m driver
   * BNXT Ethernet support
       * Extend sys/dev/bnxt.c driver with BCM58700 variant
       * Fix iflib operation without IO cache coherency

* In progress:
  * Crypto engine acceleration for IPsec offloading.

* Todo:
  * Upstreaming of work.  This work is expected to be submitted/merged
    to HEAD in the second half of 2019.

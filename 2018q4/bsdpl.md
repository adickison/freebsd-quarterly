The Polish BSD User group is an initiative promoting systems from the
BSD family. We organize both meetings and as well as tutorial
sessions. In general, we have three presentations which last around 15
minutes. Afterwards there’s an open discussions about topics related
to operating systems and security. There’s  something for everybody,
and the first presentation is about something connected to BSD and
it’s aimed at beginners. The second presentation is for more advanced
BSD users but the final talk is more general and not connected to BSD.
Usually it covers an interesting topic related to technology. Everyone
can suggest a subject for the presentations and discussions. Some
presentations from the past were about: ZFS checkpoints, GELI,
FreeNAS, PAM, DTrace, Yubikey, Pytest, ZeroTrust, Jenkins and the
iocage training session. Hope to see you there!

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the FreeBSD Release Engineering team
continued working on the 12.0-RELEASE.  The *stable/12* branch was created
on October 19, with the first BETA build being started shortly after.  The
release cycle slipped slightly with the addition of 12.0-BETA4, after which
the *releng/12.0* branch was created on November 16.

The remainder of the release cycle continued relatively smoothly for the
duration of the release candidate (RC) phase, with the final release builds
starting December 7, and the official announcement sent December 11.

Throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds were released
for the *head* and *stable/11* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.

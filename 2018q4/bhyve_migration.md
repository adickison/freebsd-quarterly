The Migration feature uses the Save/Restore feature to migrate a bhyve guest
from a FreeBSD host to another FreeBSD host. To migrate a bhyve guest,
one needs to start an empty guest on the destination host from a shared guest
image using the bhyve tool with the `-R` option followed by the source host
IP and the port to listen to migration request. On the source host, the
migration is started by executing the bhyvectl command with the `--migrate`
or `--migrate-live` option, followed by the destination host IP and the
port to send to the messages.

New features added:

   * Prove that live migration cannot be implemented using the FreeBSD's Copy-on-Write mechanism;
   * Add `--migrate-live` option to bhyvectl;
   * Add additional message exchange between source and destination host to establish the migration type and the number of rounds;
   * Implement a dirty-bit approach for live migrating the guest's wired memory;

Future tasks:

   * Clear the dirty bit after each migration round;
   * Extend live migration to highmem segment;
   * Extend live migration to unwired memory;

To whom this may concern

Since we are still on this island among many in this vast ocean of the Internet, we write this message in a bottle to inform you of the work we have finished and what lies ahead of us. These deeds that we have wrought with our minds and hands, they are for all to partake of - in the hopes that anyone of their free will, will join us in making improvements. In todays message the following by no means complete or ordered set of improvements and additions will be covered:

i386 PAE Pagetables for up to 24GB memory support, Continuous Integration efforts, driver updates to ena and graphics, ARM enhancements such as RochChip, Marvell 8K, and Broadcom support as well as more DTS files, more Capsicum possibilities, as well as pfsync improvements, and many more things that you can read about for yourselves.

Additionally, we bring news from some islands further down stream, namely the nosh project, HardenedBSD, ClonOS, and the Polish BSD User-Group.

We would, selfishly, encourage those of you who give us the good word to please send in your submissions sooner than just before the deadline, and also encourage anyone willing to share the good word to please read the section on which submissions we're also interested in having.

Yours hopefully,
Daniel Ebdrup, on behalf of the status report team.

Paragraphs are separated with an empty line.  Use Markdown
syntax, the same as you use on GitHub.  If you don't know
Markdown, just write it as if it was plain text.

Introduce your work.  Do not assume that the person reading
the report knows about your project.

Show the importance of your work.  Status reports are not
just about telling everyone that things were done, they also
need to explain why they were done.

What has happened since the last report?  Let us know what
is new in this area.

  * commit bits granted/safekept (who/why)

  * major port updates (pkg), Firefox, Chromium

If help is needed, make this explicit.  List tasks, with enough
detail that people know if they are likely to be able to do them,
and invite people to get in contact:

  * Help for PRs?
  * Help for testing?
  * Help for documentation?
